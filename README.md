# if-db

Manifests, guides, case studies and docs for Impact Framework. A place to "check in" real manifests for projects.


## Manifests

Manifest files for real projects. Each subdirectory refers to a given project. Every project *must* have a working manifest and *should* also have accompanying notes, explainers and other helpful materials.
